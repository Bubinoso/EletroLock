# EletroLock
This is my final work/project for the IT Maintenance and Support course at ETEC.

This project was carried out as a requirement for completing the IT Maintenance and Support course. In this repository I only placed the code used in the Arduino UNO R3 and an image representing the project's hardware.
The code was written by me, supervised by our teacher Wagner, who was available to help us with the project since we didn't know how to use Arduino or the C++ language. The code comments are in Portuguese because it is my native language so I will describe the project here so you can understand:
our project is an access control system for educational/professional environments using radio frequency cards. The cards are distributed by the administrator, categorized with different access levels so that there is no entry into places that are not permitted in a sector/room. When the card is brought close to the RFID reader, the code detects the card's ID and evaluates whether or not it can enter the door, lighting the correct LED and releasing the door through an electric gate lock.
